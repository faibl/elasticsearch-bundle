# ElasticsearchBundle

ElasticsearchBundle provides convenient classes, services and command to integrate PHP-Elasticsearch into Symfony.

Install the package with:

```console
composer require faibl/elasticsearch-bundle
```

And... that's it! If you're *not* using Symfony Flex, you'll also
need to enable the `Faibl\ElasticsearchBundle\FaiblElasticsearchBundle`
in your `AppKernel.php` file.

## Usage
